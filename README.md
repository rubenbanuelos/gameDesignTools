# gameDesignTools
Small repo with random stuff useful to design board games

### Description

So far I am writing most of this stuff in R because it is the fastest thing to get this stuff done, maybe I'll integrate all this in a package and maybe I'll even write a web app to use this stuff and host it in Heroku. But for now, these are some 
random functions that I think will be useful for me.

### Dependencies:

R
  gtools
  devtools
  roxygen

### TO DO

- [ ] Put this in a package
- [X] Figure out an algorithm to get ideal distributions. Found no elegant approach so far on the Internetz
- [X] Write function to determine odds of rolling a score lower than X given YdZ
- [X] Write function to determine odds of rolling a score higher than X given YdZ
- [ ] Add some documentation
- [ ] Figure out how to install dependencies along with package
- [ ] Write card drawing function
- [ ] Write function to determine success based  dice roll distributions given XdY and a difficulty Z.
- [ ] Write function to determine odds of getting a specific amount of successes given XdY and a difficulty Z.
- [ ] Write unit tests.
