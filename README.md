# gameDesignTools
Small repo with random stuff useful to design board games

### Description

So far I am writing most of this stuff in R because it is the fastest thing to get this stuff done, maybe I'll integrate all this in a package and maybe I'll even write a web app to use this stuff and host it in Heroku. But for now, these are some 
random functions that I think will be useful for me.

### Dependencies:

R
